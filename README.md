# Does Higher Pay Mean Better Performance in the NBA?
Exploring the relationship between player salaries and on-court performance in the NBA.
And exploring salary over time, adjusted for inflation

Avg pay has been rising in the NBA.  Is this  due to to inflation, or are players getting better? (or is it a combination of the two?)

Used NBA player salary data as well as data that tallied total number of minutes played & points scored by each player per game.
Data for these metrics spanned seasons from 2015 to 2020.
All dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation and are reported in 2015 dollars.

### Is this trend due to inflation?

Figure 1 displays box and whisker plots of player salaries accross seasons adjusted for inflaton.
Despite controlling for inflation, both the average and maximum player salaries were on the rise from 2015 to 2020—albeit at different rates. 
The median salary remained relatively static accross the seasons examined with the esception of a slight increase in 2019 & 2020.  Thus, the rise in average salaries is driven largely by the outliers: the top-paid players. The top salary in the NBA was $23.50 million in 2015, and $36.84 million in 2020 (in 2015 dollars).

### Is this trend due to an increase in performance? 

Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of average points per minute against average salary per player.

#### Figure 2: Average Points per Minute vs. Average Salary per Player.
Each dot represents an individual player’s average points per minute and average salary over the five-year period. A warmer color represents a higher level of scoring perfomance, and a cooler color represents a lower level of scoring performance. Player salaries are reported in 2015 dollars.

(Note: this analysis only takes into account points scored.  There are other metrics of performance (i.e. shots blocked, etc.) that were not accounted for in this analysis).

### Thus, there is a positive correlation between this points scored per minute performance metric and salary!

However, futher analysis, (i.e. performance metric by position) is needed to make any conclusive statements about the causation of the increase in top player salaries.
